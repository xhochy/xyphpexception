A small library in/for PHP (projects) to handle and throw exceptions. The main features are stack generation, debug-value saving and e-mail alerts.

Because it uses the new exceptions, class-syntax and some function of PHP 5, it isn't backwards compatible to PHP 4.

The initial code was commited by [XhochY](http://xhochy.org)
